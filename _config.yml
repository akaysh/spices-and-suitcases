description: "We're a couple who couldn't be more differentâ€”he's a gourmet chef, she's all about street food; he's a thrill-seeker, she's a homebody. But together, we're on a mission to prove that opposites not only attract, they also cook and travel pretty darn well. Follow us as we wander the world one meal at a time (and probably argue over the spice level while we're at it)!"
