Meet the gourmet half of our duo! He's the one who can't resist trying that sketchy-looking street cart (and somehow never gets sick), who packs hot sauce in his carry-on, and who thinks "mild" is just a suggestion.

When he's not in the kitchen experimenting with flavor combinations that shouldn't work but somehow do, you'll find him planning our next adventure - preferably something that involves heights, speed, or both. He's the reason we've eaten guinea pig in Peru, gone bungee jumping in New Zealand, and why our spice collection takes up an entire cabinet.

His travel philosophy: "If it doesn't scare you a little, it's probably not worth doing." His cooking philosophy: "More spice, more life!"
