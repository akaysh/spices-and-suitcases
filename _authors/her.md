The heart and soul of our planning operations! While he's off looking for the next cliff to jump from, she's the one making sure we actually have a place to sleep and that our budget won't send us to the poorhouse.

She has an uncanny ability to find the most amazing street food vendors - the ones locals line up for but tourists never discover. Her idea of the perfect travel day? Wandering through local markets, trying authentic snacks, and finding cozy cafes where you can people-watch for hours.

At home, she's the queen of organization and creating spaces that make you want to curl up with a good book and never leave. She's also our financial guru, budget planner, and the reason we can afford to travel as much as we do.

Her travel philosophy: "The best adventures happen when you slow down and pay attention." Her life philosophy: "A well-organized space is a happy space!"
