# The Books That Started It All

**His confession**: "I never really wanted to travel until I read 'On the Road.' Then I couldn't sit still."

**My confession**: "I've been planning imaginary trips since I read 'A Year in Provence' at age 16."

Books have this incredible power to transport you somewhere else entirely - sometimes literally. Over the years, we've collected quite a library of books that either make us want to pack our bags immediately or make us grateful for our cozy reading nook at home.

Here are the books that have shaped our wanderlust, organized by the type of trip they'll make you want to take.

## Books That Make You Want to Drop Everything and Go

### "Wild" by Cheryl Strayed
**His take**: "Made me want to hike the PCT, until I remembered I don't really like camping."
**My take**: "The ultimate story of finding yourself through travel, even when everything goes wrong."

**Why it works**: Raw honesty about both the beauty and brutality of solo travel. Plus, it's proof that you don't have to be an expert to have an adventure.

**Will inspire you to**: Take that solo trip you've been thinking about.

### "Eat, Pray, Love" by Elizabeth Gilbert
**His take**: "I skipped the pray part and focused on the eat part. The Italy section made me book a food tour."
**My take**: "Say what you want about the privilege, but the idea of giving yourself permission to explore is powerful."

**Why it works**: It's about more than travel - it's about using travel as a tool for self-discovery.

**Will inspire you to**: Plan a trip around food, spirituality, or personal growth.

### "The Beach" by Alex Garland
**His take**: "This book made me want to find my own secret paradise. Also made me very wary of other backpackers."
**My take**: "Beautiful writing about Thailand, but also a cautionary tale about paradise lost."

**Why it works**: Captures both the allure and the danger of seeking perfection in travel.

**Will inspire you to**: Visit Thailand (but maybe skip the secret beach part).

## Books for the Adventure Seeker

### "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer
**His obsession**: "I've read this three times. Makes me want to climb Everest and never climb Everest at the same time."
**My reaction**: "Terrifying and fascinating. I'll stick to reading about extreme adventures."

**Why it's compelling**: Shows what happens when adventure goes very, very wrong, but somehow makes you want to try anyway.

**Will inspire you to**: Research mountaineering courses or be very grateful for your sea-level adventures.

### "Touching the Void" by Joe Simpson
**His take**: "The most intense survival story ever written. Made me pack better emergency supplies."
**My take**: "Proof that sometimes the best adventures are the ones you survive to tell about."

**Why it works**: Ultimate testament to human resilience and the power of determination.

**Will inspire you to**: Take a wilderness first aid course and maybe reconsider that extreme hiking trip.

## Books for the Cultural Explorer

### "A Year in Provence" by Peter Mayle
**My favorite**: "This book taught me that the best travel is about slowing down and really experiencing a place."
**His opinion**: "Made me understand why people become expats. Also made me very hungry."

**Why it's timeless**: Captures the joy of immersing yourself in a different culture and lifestyle.

**Will inspire you to**: Look into long-term stays and really get to know a place.

### "The Geography of Bliss" by Eric Weiner
**Both of us**: "Part travel memoir, part philosophy, all fascinating."

**Why it works**: Combines travel with big questions about happiness and what makes life meaningful.

**Will inspire you to**: Travel with a purpose beyond just sightseeing.

### "River Town" by Peter Hessler
**My pick**: "Beautiful writing about teaching English in rural China. Shows how travel can be about connection, not just consumption."
**His take**: "Made me want to teach abroad, until I remembered I'm not a teacher."

**Why it resonates**: About finding meaning through service and cultural exchange.

**Will inspire you to**: Look into volunteer travel or teaching opportunities abroad.

## Books That Make Home Look Pretty Good

### "The Hygge Home" by Meik Wiking
**My comfort read**: "After reading about Danish coziness, I just want to light candles and make our apartment perfect."
**His reaction**: "Makes me want to buy more blankets and never leave the house."

**Why we love it**: Sometimes the best journey is creating a space you never want to leave.

**Will inspire you to**: Redecorate your space and appreciate home comforts.

### "A Gentleman in Moscow" by Amor Towles
**Both of us**: "Proof that you can have incredible adventures without ever leaving one building."

**Why it's magical**: Shows that adventure is a state of mind, not a location.

**Will inspire you to**: Find adventure in your own city and appreciate what's around you.

## Books for the Food Traveler

### "Kitchen Confidential" by Anthony Bourdain
**His bible**: "This book changed how I think about food, travel, and life. RIP to the GOAT."
**My take**: "Made me want to eat at every hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the world."

**Why it's essential**: Connects food, travel, and authentic cultural experiences.

**Will inspire you to**: Seek out local food experiences and avoid tourist restaurants.

### "The Hundred-Foot Journey" by Richard C. Morais
**My pick**: "Beautiful story about food bridging cultures. Made me cry and made me hungry."
**His opinion**: "Good story, but the movie made me hungrier."

**Why it works**: Shows how food can be a universal language and bridge between cultures.

**Will inspire you to**: Take a cooking class abroad or explore ethnic restaurants at home.

## Books for the Planner

### "The Art of Travel" by Alain de Botton
**My favorite philosophy**: "Travel is not just about where you go, but how you see."
**His take**: "Made me think more deeply about why we travel, not just where."

**Why it's important**: Philosophical approach to travel that makes you a more thoughtful traveler.

**Will inspire you to**: Travel with intention and really pay attention to your experiences.

### "Vagabonding" by Rolf Potts
**Both of us**: "The ultimate guide to long-term travel and making it financially possible."

**Why it's practical**: Combines philosophy with practical advice about funding extended travel.

**Will inspire you to**: Start saving for that round-the-world trip.

## Books That Changed Our Perspective

### "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho
**His journey**: "Cheesy but true - sometimes you have to travel to find what you're looking for."
**My take**: "About following your dreams, even when they seem impossible."

**Why it resonates**: Universal story about pursuing your path, wherever it leads.

**Will inspire you to**: Take that leap you've been considering.

## Our Reading Challenge for Travelers

We've started a tradition: for every trip we take, we read one book set in that location before we go and one book by a local author while we're there. It's completely changed how we experience places.

### Before You Go:
- Read fiction set in your destination
- Research local authors and pick up their work
- Look for travel memoirs about your specific region

### While You're There:
- Visit local bookstores
- Buy books by local authors
- Read about the history and culture of where you are

### After You Return:
- Read more deeply about places that fascinated you
- Share book recommendations with other travelers
- Start planning your next trip based on what you've read

## Building Your Travel Library

### For Inspiration:
- Mix memoirs with fiction
- Include different types of travel (adventure, cultural, food-focused)
- Don't forget books that celebrate home

### For Practical Planning:
- Guidebooks are still valuable
- Cultural guides help you understand context
- Language learning books for longer trips

### For Reflection:
- Philosophy of travel books
- Books that challenge your assumptions
- Stories from perspectives different from your own
